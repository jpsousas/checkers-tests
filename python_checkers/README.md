# Checkers in Python

## About
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts):
>Draughts or checkers is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces.

This was made using Python and the pygame module with the goal of studying OOP.


## Installation and usage
1. [Activate](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#activators) the virtual environment if you don't have pygame installed on your machine.
2. Run `python checkers.py <gamemode>` to run the game. Gamemode can be either "cpu" or "pvp" for singleplayer or local multiplayer.

## Singleplayer
The computer you can play against in this game is a fairly simple one implemented using the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

In a nutshell, it works by simulating every possible outcome from the current board and assuming each player will make the "best" move.
This is a rather simple algorithm, which means the computer will not play using any strategies such as baiting the opponent to jump one of its pieces.
